# Village Project Citizen Building Crew - Website

Welcome to the online presence of the Village Project Citizen Building Crew! This README file provides an overview of the website that I have created.

## About the Project

The Village Project Citizen Building Crew is an initiative dedicated to improving the village community. They work on various projects from restoring the village church to caring for village culture and animal welfare.

## The Website

The website of the Citizen Building Crew was created by me. It serves to document the project's work, inform the community, and attract new potential  members.

## Website Features

-   **Project Documentation:** The website documents ongoing projects and their progress to give visitors insight into the work of the Citizen Building Crew organization.
    
-   **Event Information:** Visitors can find information about upcoming events, workdays, and meetings of Citizen Building Crew.
    
-   **Contact Options:** Contact information is provided so that interested parties can reach out to the project, whether for questions, suggestions, or to get involved.

-  **Legal Compliance:** I have ensured that the website complies with data privacy regulations and the legal requirements regarding an imprint (Impressum) as per the local laws.
    

## Maintenance and Updates

As a programmer, I am responsible for maintaining and updating the website. All changes, updates, and technical adjustments are handled by me.
